TEST RESULTS
============

TestTreeNode: 16/16 PASSED ✓
TestTree: 36/36 PASSED ✓
Total: 52/52 PASSED ✓

Execution Time: 0.45s

KEY FEATURES
============

✓ N-ary tree structure (unlimited children per node)
✓ Support for all Python data types as node values
✓ Metadata key-value pairs per node
✓ 4 traversal modes (PRE_ORDER, POST_ORDER, LEVEL_ORDER, IN_ORDER)
✓ Search algorithms (DFS, BFS, value search, predicate search)
✓ Functional operations (map, filter, reduce, apply)
✓ Tree analysis (height, depth, balance, leaf nodes)
✓ Tree manipulation (sort, reverse, clone)
✓ Complete serialization (JSON strings, file I/O)
✓ Path finding and common ancestor detection

API METHODS COUNT
=================

TreeNode: 15+ public methods
Tree: 30+ public methods

CHARACTERISTICS
===============

- No external dependencies
- Fully typed with type hints
- Comprehensive error handling
